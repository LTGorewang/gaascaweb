<h1>ABOUT US GAASCA</h1>

<img class="img2" src="about.jpg" alt="About Us" width="450px" height="450px">
<p style="font-size: 18px;">Galeshewe Association for Care of Aged and Disabled (GAASCA) is a non-governmental Organisation and runs a Day Care Centre and Assisted Living Units for older and older disabled persons on a five day week basis. The Centre provides active ageing, developmental programmes, assisted living units and a well balanced meal on a daily basis. In terms of sustainability we mostly depend on the monthly subsidy from the Department of Social Development, fund raising and donations from some local business people, besides the monthly fees paid by the residents at the facility.</p>
<P style="font-size: 18px;">Our Organisation is a legal entity and we are in compliance with the Older Persons Act 2006 Act no. 13 2006 and registered as a Non-Profit Organisation with Non-Profit-Organisation Directorate and our registration number is; 010-965 NPO (certificate attached). The Organisation is managed by a governing board for a period of two years consisting of the executive (top five), two additional members, two beneficiaries representative and the Centre Manager as ex-officio. The Organisation also has a constitution that is guiding the operations of the Centre.</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">This Centre was established to perform active ageing through educational programmes, governmental programmes and activities that are relevant to the elderly. This project performs well by caring for the aged and disabled groups. The staff working with such groups are very passionate but, also go through stress due to lack of financial resources (lack of regular stipends)</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">The wish of management is to convert this facility to a multi-purpose Centre in order to extend our support to all vulnerable older and disabled persons and ensure a safe and secure environment for them. This is also the only facility of its kind in Galeshewe and due to its uniqueness, we request all funding Institutions/Organisation and individuals who have the interest of the disadvantaged older and disabled persons at heart to fully support this project financially in order to preserve the rights and dignity of the older and disabled persons.</p>

<li>Women and children abuse</li>
 <li>Create a mechanism to assist in the alleviation of poverty, distress or any social related problems.</li>
<Li>We need to engage the Department of Health to provide us with a mobile clinic on site in order to avoid the long queuing by the elderly at the clinics.</LI>
<li>We also have to get a qualified nurse to come on board in terms of managing the distribution of medication by the care givers but, we donâ€™t have the financial muscle to secure one in that regard.</li>
<li>Strengthening our relationship with all relevant stakeholders with similar aims and objectives as well state departments for support.</li>
